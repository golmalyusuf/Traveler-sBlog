I have been pushing code an other repository but there was some issue. So i have created a new repository.
Previous repository link: https://github.com/golmalyusuf/Travel-s-Blog.git


**I have been facing an error after connecting to the git. Error message is here: 
Parameter 0 of constructor in com.yusuf.travel.serviceimpl.UserServiceImpl required a bean of type 'com.yusuf.travel.repository.UserRepository' that could not be found.
Action:
Consider defining a bean of type 'com.yusuf.travel.repository.UserRepository' in your configuration.


So To run the applicaiton may be we need to create a new projects and copy all the packages, Html files, application properties file, and Data.sql file in the new project. And the project will be good to run. I have been trying to fix the issuse. But as there is very little time I couldn't look into it properly.
